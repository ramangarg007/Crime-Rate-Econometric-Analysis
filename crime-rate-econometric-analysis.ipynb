Conclusion\n","\n","For this project we were provided with the dataset which includes information on crime in 90 counties in North Carolina, for the years 1981 through 1987. The research question selected was “Do the probabilities of apprehension and punishment affect crime participation rate?”. First we notice that the data category provided to us is panel data, we start by building a simple OLS model and observe that the coefficient of probability of prison sentence is negative which does not align with our assumption. Due to the data being panel data simple OLS model constructed can suffer from inconsistencies and bias. To prove that we should not be using the pooled OLS model that will suffer from problem of endogeneity caused by unobserved Heterogeneity we check our assumption (3a) Homoskedasticity using the Breusch-Pagan test and our assumption (3b) Non-autocorrelation using The Durbin-Watson-Test and find observe that the assumption 3 as a whole has been violated and conclude that we should be using Fixed effect or Random effect model for our regression. To select one model from Fixed effect model and Random effect model we use Hausman test which is a statistical test used to compare the consistency and efficiency of two different estimators and select the Fixed Effect Estimator. The R squared value of 0.0811 which indicates we explain 8.11% of variation in our dependent variable.\n","\n","The coefficients from our fixed effect model are all negative confirming our initial assumption that all of the independent variables are negatively related to the crime rate or if any of the independent variable increase crime rate will decrease. The coefficient of β_3 is -0.30241 which had a significant impact on the crime rate and could be used by policy makers, implies 1 unit increase in probability of prison sentence will lead to -30.24% change in crime rate. We tested the significance of our coefficients and find that all the independent variables are significant proving yes probabilities of apprehension and punishment do affect crime participation rate.\n","\n","Although we have provided significant results, we acknowledge that R-Squared values is on the small end. We can describe better if we can gather data on unemployment levels and if we want to compare the crime rate in recent years we can utilize the covid cases as well along with education levels as all of these factors are used to better describe the crime rate. If we consider the limitations of fixed effect model we can say that The fixed effect model is not suitable for analyzing the effects of variables that do not change over time within entities (individuals, groups, etc.). These time-invariant variables are absorbed by the fixed effects, and their impact cannot be estimated in the model."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"R","language":"R","name":"ir"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":"r","file_extension":".r","mimetype":"text/x-r-source","name":"R","pygments_lexer":"r","version":"4.0.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
